# GO language by Google

This repository consist of some small notes I've taken while learning Go - **the Resources folder**
and some of my little projects - in **the Code folder**. If you feel like there is something
you may learn from this repository - just do it. __*\*Insert meme here *\*__ .
But it was in no way started as a learning guide,just remember this.
